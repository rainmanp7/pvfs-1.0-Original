01/15/2001
----------
- fixed bug in mgrcomm.c which would cause first request to a restarted
  manager to fail

[lazy bug fixers didn't log changes for a bit]

10/27/2000
----------
- most instances of syscall() are removed; there are still some left to
  deal with though
- libminipvfs is now installed along with everything else
- libpvfs is no longer created
- struct pvfs_stat changed to struct pvfs_filestat to fix naming oddity
  that has been in lib forever (pvfs_ostat()).

6/16/2000
----------
- manager and iod both now include linux/fs.h.  This mainly provides a
  reasonable value for NR_OPEN, the max number of open files.  This
  inclusion can be toggled off with __FS_H_IS_OK__ in config.h.  --Phil

03/29/2000
----------
- cut down manager default logging substantially.
- manager now includes -r option for using a random base node number
  instead of 0 for default.
- manager now uses SO_REUSEADDR to enable restarting more quickly.  iod
  uses this too.  bind() problems should be gone.
- Configuration defines are better documented in pvfs_config.h:
  __ALPHA__ for Alpha processors (still not quite there),
  LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT for >2GB files (also still not quite there),
  __USE_SENDFILE__ for using sendfile() on the iod (not faster?).
- sendfile() support is now added to the iod.
- TCP_CORK is available on iods and in library (not working in iod?
  undefined at top of jobs.c to prevent its use for now).
- library sleeps and retries connect() when an EAGAIN error is
  encountered (gracefully handles no-sockets problem)
- big memory leak in manager fixed

01/31/2000
----------
- all metadata reading and writing operations are now in the mgr/meta
  directory and are handled by the manager; applications only see what
  is passed back to them through pvfs calls.

01/14/2000
----------
- integrated filter_dirents() into the manager to pull reserved names
  out of getdents output.  This eliminates the need to check for these
  names on the client side (which is good, since the VFS code doesn't do
  that)
- now using resv_name() check in the check_pvfs() call, so it no longer
  incorrectly detects names as reserved when they aren't (eg.
  .pvfsdir.saveme).

01/13/2000
----------
- removed uncalled functions
- added resv_name.c in shared directory
- modified mgr to use resv_name for all incoming names, return ENOENT if
  name is reserved
- took out __USE_NFS__ code
- fixed bug in pvfs_rename which was causing segfaults
- fixed bug in put_dmeta() which was causing the .pvfsdir corruption

11/08/1999
----------
- added pvfstab man page
- updated User Guide to discuss pvfstab file and changes WRT NFS
- fixed bug in statfs() call which was causing xterms, vi, tcsh, etc. to
  fail

10/21/1999
----------
- added sample pvfstab file
- modified pvfs spec file; copies pvfstab into place, tags configs files
  appropriately (so rpm doesn't overwrite on package update)

10/20/1999 (v1.4.2-pre5)
------------------------
- now mostly working without NFS
- lack of chdir() and getcwd() support (along with no NFS) breaks:
	* rm -rf <dir> (rm tries to chdir() into directories)
	* mv <dir> (mv tries to chdir() into directories too)
- other miscellaneous resulting problems:
	* no wildcards (unless you start a shell with LD_PRELOAD set)
	* if you do start the shell, vi doesn't work right (?)

TODO
----
- maybe do a chdir() and a getcwd() wrapper?
- sendfile() in iod/jobs.c:do_access() for read accesses w/linux2.2

OTHER KNOWN BUGS
----------------
- files accessed with stdio calls don't get final buffers written if not
  explicitly closed (?)
