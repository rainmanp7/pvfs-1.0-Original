Resurected 01-27-2021 By: rainmanp7 aka Christopher W. Brown. The Original Linux Parallel Virtual File System


The Parallel Virtual File System, Version 1.0


    Parallel Architecture Research Laboratory, Clemson University

Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory

PVFS is a next generation parallel file system for Linux clusters. It
harnesses commodity storage and network technology to provide concurrent
access to data that is distributed across a (possibly large) collection
of servers.  PVFS serves as both a testbed for parallel I/O research
and as a freely available production-level tool for the cluster community.

See the top level GPL COPYING file for license information.
