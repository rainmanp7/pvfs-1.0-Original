To install, run:

  ./configure; make

Then maybe "make install"; up to you.  By default mount.pvfs is placed
in /sbin and pvfsd in /usr/local/sbin.  I don't know how to place the
module properly, so I leave that to you.

Note to Redhat 7.0 users:
--------------------------------------
Redhat 7.0 ships with an extra version of gcc that must be used for
compiling kernel code.  This version of gcc is called kgcc by Redhat.
Before you run the configure script, please use the following command to
set the default gcc for your session:

for bash users:
# export CC='kgcc'

for tcsh users:
> setenv CC 'kgcc'

Also note that if you are using Redhat 7.0 and wish to compile
pvfs-kernel against a different kernel version than the one that shipped
with your installation, you need to modify the above command to indicate
the correct include path:

for bash users:
# export CC='kgcc -I/usr/src/linux/include'

for tcsh users:
> setenv CC 'kgcc -I/usr/src/linux/include'

---------------------------------------


The configure script does a LOT of testing.  There are lots of options
to the Linux kernel.  There are lots of changes between the two
versions.  It's important that we figure out what is really going on.
In general, if configure doesn't see some feature that you think should
have been detected, it's probably because your header files are wrong
(i.e. /usr/include/linux points to the wrong place).

The configure/autoconf stuff isn't perfect; you might have to edit the
Makefile to get things right.  Sorry!  Let me know if you have
suggestions on how to make this better. -- Rob

Common errors/warnings:

1) error: libminipvfs.a not found.

  It's not in a standard library path, or PVFS hasn't been installed.
  If PVFS is installed, you just need to specify the location of your 
  libminipvfs.a with:

  ./configure --with-libpvfs-dir=/whateverdir/lib

2) warning: compiler includes could cause problems.

  It seems that the asm/posix_types.h that is provided with some gcc
  versions conflicts with some of the internal Linux structures.  We
  test for this in the configure process so we know it could happen
  ahead of time, and we adjust our CFLAGS to try to work around the
  problem.  The work-around does in fact avoid the problem on a number
  of platforms; if it doesn't work for you, you might want to try a
  different compiler (i.e. set your CC environement variable to point to
  some other compiler, such as egcs or kgcc).

3) warning: no XXX; assuming version 2.2.

  One of the executables the tests use to determine the kernel version
  wasn't present, so it just assumed that you have the right kernel.

4) warning: PVFS kernel patch is deprecated.

  With new rawio patches, it is no longer necessary (or desirable) to
  apply the PVFS kernel patch.  All necessary PVFS functionality can
  instead be built into our module.

  This warning is simply to remind you that you don't have to patch any
  more; everything will still operate normally.  See the README for more
  information.

5) warning: old rawio patch detected.

  The configure script has detected that an old version of the rawio
  patch was applied on this system.  This is indicated by the presence
  of the linux/iobuf.h header file but the absence of the functions in
  /proc/ksyms.

  This warning is simply to remind you that there is a new rawio patch
  that provides better functionality (i.e. you don't have to patch with
  the PVFS patch too); everything will still operate normally.  See the
  README for more information.
